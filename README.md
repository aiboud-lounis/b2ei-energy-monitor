# [B2EI](http://www.b2ei.com) energy monitor

An open source project to monitor easily your energy consumption on your building.

Developed by  [B2EI](http://www.b2ei.com) with Laravel, angularjs and some other open source frameworks and libraries.

Don't use B2EI energy monitor at the moment, it's a beta version with some bugs, we will correct them as soon as possible.

### Next steps : 
 - Bug correction and interface finalisation
 - Support product from XLS (actually product elements are stored on PHP class files, we will create a custom product that load all it parameters from an xls file to provide a simple way to add equipments)
 - Notification support (add toggleable notification on equipment fault)
 - Generate an image for raspberry pi (based on Raspbian).
 - Integrate Modbus server, MQTT support for AWS support and maybe an OPC server.
 - Integrate blockchain support (we are looking on ethereum smart contract to provide a smart, secure and decentralized logging provider for your data).
